Using the Debian base CD install ISO, create a bootable USB drive follow these instructions:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/16988/how-do-i-install-ubuntu-to-a-usb-key
Use answer #1, except stop after formatting the USB disk

Download the latest Debian DVD ISO, and create the DVD from it

Boot to the DVD, and select the USB drive as your destination partiton

Do not use automatic partitioning, but rather use manual and set the whole drive as 
	the root "/" mount point
Make sure to add the noatime option under Options on the partition screen

Complete the install, but install nothing on the options screen except the base system utilities

Give the root user the password - technet123
Create a user known as - diskwipe
Give the diskwipe user the password of - password

Let the installation finish

setup the autologin

at the prompt - su -c "nano /etc/initab" and enter the password for root when prompted
comment out the line that reads - 1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
	it may not look exactly like that, but it will be close

add the following line right below the line you just commented out
	1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f diskwipe tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1
	
Save the file by hitting Ctrl+X and follow the save prompts

Now when you reboot you should auto-login to the prompt

at the prompt - su -c "apt-get update" and enter the password for root when prompted
at the prompt - su -c "apt-get install php5-cli php-pear hdparm dmidecode" and enter
	the password for root when prompted

Accept the package selection that is provided by the apt-get function

at the prompt - su -c "pear channel-update pear.php.net" and enter password for root when prompted
at the prompt - su -c "pear install -f XML_RPC" and enter password for root when prompted
at the prompt - su -c "pear install -f XML_RPC2" and enter password for root when prompted

at the prompt - su -c "visudo" and enter the password for root when prompted

find the line that states root ALL=(ALL) ALL
add a line directly below that to read
diskwipe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/sbin/hdparm, /bin/chown, /usr/sbin/dmidecode, /sbin/fdisk

Save the file by hitting Ctrl+X and follow the save prompts

Reboot into thumbdrive - su -c "reboot" and enter root password when prompted

You should make sure to hit the boot menu button in the BIOS to make sure that you select the USB
	drive and not the default hard drive

Now your system should be setup to be used
